> **Description:**
>
> This project implements a desgin of one's choice in MIT's block-based and visual programming platform -- [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). The program I designed and developed, Planets Spiral Orbit, features two planets that orbit a common sun; as time passes, they both spiral out from their sun.
