# **0xff CS50 Projects**

## Description:
This repository hosts a series of code snippets and projects completed through HarvardX's F'20 & S'21 CS50 course.<br/>
*The programs are written in C, the programming language used throughout both courses.* <br/>

# **Project List**
### **1. Scratch Playground**
* *Assignment Link: [CS50 F'20 - Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/0/scratch/)* | *[CS50 S'21 - Scratch](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/)*
* *Scratch Link: [Planets Spiral Orbit](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/451801134)*
* *File: [`SB3 File`](Projects/1.%20Scratch%20Playground/Planets%20Spiral%20Orbit.sb3)*
> **Description:**
>
> This project implements a desgin of one's choice in MIT's block-based and visual programming platform - [scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu). The program I created and developed, `Planets Spiral Orbit`, features two planets that orbit a common star, their sun; which they spiral out of as time passes.

### **2. Hello World**
* *Assignment Link: [CS50 F'20 - Hello World](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/hello/)* | *[CS50 S'21 - Hello World](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/hello/)*
* *File: [`hello.c`](Projects/2.%20Hello%20World/hello.c)*
> **Description:**
>
> This program prompts the user for a `name` and prints "hello, `name`" to the console; a variation of new programmer's traditional first written program 'hello world.' *The source code file includes notes from class that explain C's syntax and a few important introductory guidelines (or rules of C) for beginners in the subject.*

<br/><br/>

### **3. Mario**
* *Assignment Link: [CS50 F'20 - Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2020/psets/1/mario/more/)* | *[CS50 S'21 - Mario](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2021/psets/1/mario/more/)*
* *File: [`mario.c`](Projects/3.%20Mario/mario.c)*
> **Description:**
>
> This program prompts the user for a `height` and draws two adjecent pyramids of such, separated by spaces. The pyramids are modeled after those that appear in Nintendoâ€™s Super Mario Brothers videogame, using hashes (#) to represent bricks. There are two versions of the program, each of which uses a different approach: `mario.c` uses relational positioning and `marioe.c` uses euclidean transformation.
